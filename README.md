**MERN Stack Developer | Backend-Focused | Fresher Open to Opportunities**

I build full-stack web applications with a strong focus on backend development — REST APIs, authentication, authorization, and database design. I enjoy working close to real-world problems rather than demo-level projects.

Currently looking for a **junior / fresher MERN or backend developer role**, open to starting with a learning-focused package.
